      question: 'How does the Growth Audit work?',
      answer:

    {
      question: 'How do I get started?',
      answer:
        'The first step is to request a Growth Audit by filling out our short questionnaire, or message us directly on WhatsApp (+91 96488 52456). We will evaluate your practice, discuss your objectives, and outline a tailored growth roadmap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you guarantee results?',
      answer:
